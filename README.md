##  Basic Type

string — This is effectively anything in quotes, though template literals (a.k.a. template strings) are also valid values for strings.
number — This is, well, a number. Any number that is valid in JavaScript is valid as this type, such as integers, floating points, and etc.
boolean — A boolean is any value that evaluates to exactly true or exactly false. A valid boolean will always be the keyword true or the keyword false.
Array — An array is a set of values. Arrays in TypeScript are very similar to those in JavaScript, but you must provide a type for your array which indicates the type of values the array contains. For example, Array<string> would indicate an array of strings. We’ll dig deeper in the next part of this series.
void and undefined — These values are commonly used to specifically denote that something will return no value or is literally undefined. This topic is best left for our next lesson.
any — This is literally any and all types as a possibility. For example, you will commonly assign any when you’re starting to type a new object and you haven’t determined all the types. The rule of thumb is you probably shouldn’t use this in a permanent fashion.
